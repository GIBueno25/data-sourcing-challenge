# **MODULE 6 CHALLENGE**

## **CME - GST**
The purpose of this assignment is to preare a dataset to help predict Geomagnetic Storms (GST). Since GME's are known to be caused by Coronal Mass Ejections (CME), understanding the amount of time a GME occurs after a CME would help develop a system to make these predictions.

This challenge requires students to extract 2 sets of data from the NASA API. Each data set is converted into data frames, cleaned, then merged into 1 data frame. It then calculates the average time difference between when GST and CME occurs. A new data frame is created then exported into a CSV file.
